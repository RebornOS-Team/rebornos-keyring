**How to get the value indicated above?**

Once we have the gpg key created in our system, it will be enough to execute the following from the terminal:

```
$ gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG
/home/user/.gnupg/pubring.kbx
-----------------------------
sec   rsa4096/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 2019-09-05 [SC]
      xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx --> **Send me this number**
uid   ....
ssb   rsa4096/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```


Send me the number marked by -->****Send me this number****  and also send me your **gpg public key**.

Your public gpg key must be in the file **rebornos.gpg** (the format is clearly visible when accessing that file).

How do you send your public pgp key to a file? From the terminal, it is done with:

```
gpg --armor --export >> your_name_for_example.asc
```

Please, send me this file.

Checking what is needed: it is the file with your **public pgp key**, and the value indicated above.
